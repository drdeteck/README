# Self Selection Team Creation

>DO WHAT IS BEST FOR YOUR COMPANY

Self Selection Team Creation is giving back the decision process of forming team to the team members. 

## For
- opportunity for developers to get involved in strategic decisions and understand the needs of the business
- if you give people the power to take difficult and informed decisions, they will become motivated, no matter how tough the decision is
- people are at their happiest and most productive if they can choose what they work on and who they work with.
- Informed Decision
- more stable, happier, more productive, more motivated
- Fast forward into "forming, storming, norming, performing" team building

## Contre
- "worst case scenario" was that we would have gained a good knowledge of what people want and how they work together
- The level of energy in the room was great until we faced the first stall. We realised that we had done lots of preparation to handle noise and arguments, but little to handle silence.
- Isolement, cliques 
- Souvent les probl√®mes ne sont pas ceux √† quoi on s'attendait. Il est fortement recommander de se sur-pr√©parer plut√¥t que de se sous-pr√©parer..

## Pr√©paration
- From preparing the teams, preparing a list of FAQs, printing pictures and needed material
- Aucun gestionnaire doit s'en m√™ler. (we shouldn‚Äôt have given management the temptation to jump in and we should have kept them out of the room.)
- We would have a better plan to unblock stalls
- Shared, clear goal makes everything so much easier
- Each team should have a name, a clear mission for what it will do and a product owner established in advance
- We recommend keeping rules and constraints to a minimum
